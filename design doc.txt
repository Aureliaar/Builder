Project: CityBuilder.
Genre: City Goddamn Builder.

Status: Programming framework, camera working, general inheritance structure ready.

Ambient: Three options being considered:
	'Crystal, Togas and Spires' fantasy
	Steampunk
	Medioeval kind-of-realistic

Key concept:
	Winter\Spring\Summer\Fall cycle. WINTER IS COMING, and you'd better survive it.
		Winter lasts a variable amount of man-years.
		Possible need to fend off invasions and\or catalysms in the later stages of the game.

	Humans\Servants split:
		Humans are very limited in number, and do flexible roles. Gain experience in the jobs they perform, and unlock new jobs. Their number is small enough for each to be known by name from the player.

		Servants are basically a commodity. Every servant requires some form of energy to work, can only do one type of job, and has to be built and maintained by a human. Try: Servants are robots\spirits, that can combine into higher jobs.

		Buildings enable Humans and\or Servants of appropriate job to work in them.

		Any un-assigned Human, and certain types of idling Servants, are automatically filled into the "Hauler" job.

	Superprojects as new-mode gameplay and\or win conditions.

	Different features unlock in different eras. 



Basic CB Concept:
	To function, a city needs inhabitants, which have needs and provide as workers. 
	To fulfill the needs, workers get assigned to buildings, and produce and redistribute goods.
	So, the following entities are in the game:
		Inhabitants, which are both Humand and Robots\Spirits, which consume and produce;
		Goods, which are produced, stored and consumed.
		Buildings, which are built (duh) and unlock further job roles.

Needs:
	The foundation of it all is, of course, needs. Those can divided in three groups:
		- Vital: Without this, your people die. Food, Water, Clothing\Heat during cold seasons.
		- Working: Without those, certain types of work cannot be done. Work tools, Mana for spirits; ...
		- Luxury: Those provide certain bonuses. Jewelry, ...

Jobs:
	Jobs are the roles citizien take to produce goods.
	There's two basic roles, which do not require any buildings and are unlimited:
		- Hauler: Moves Goods from where they are to where they need to be.
		- Builder: Constructs buildings.

	In the first particular feature of our CityBuilder, Jobs assume two different shapes: Those for Humans, and those for Spirits.
	Humans can be any different job they're skilled for, and they consume goods at varying rates.
	Spirits ARE a particular job, and can be evolved by fusing them into better jobs.
	Certain jobs, which can be high-end things or improved versions of Spirit jobs, can be human-only. 
		For example, a job could be Spirit Handler, making the building responsible for Spirit work function;
		Another could be Spellcaster, unlocking special commands;
		Or they could simple be a Teleporting Hauler, able to do the work of a Hauler spirit in a Space-Agnostic way.

	A preliminary list of Jobs, for spirits and humans akin, could be the following:

	Epoch 1 (Arrival, humans-only)
